    "# Project 1 - Tile image pre-processing (v1)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Project 1, your `tile-images` directory is used for your tiles to make your mosaic.  This program will pre-process your tile images to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert every image to an RGB format (in case they are greyscale or transparent),\n",
    "  - Grayscale and transparent images don't have full color data and you can't find the average color without color data! :(\n",
    "2. Scale every image to a smaller size, and\n",
    "  - Smaller images will be faster to calculate the average image color.\n",
    "3. Transform your image to a square image\n",
    "  - The final mosaic only uses square regions of your image -- by pre-processing your images into squares you will get the best possible average color.\n",
    "4. Delete any non-image files\n",
    "  - Mac OSX likes to put a file called `.DS_Stroe` in with your images.  This can cause some problems for Mac users.\n",
